                    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
                    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
                    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
                    HEREUNDER.
                
                Statement of Purpose
                
                The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
                exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
                and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
                authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
                
                Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
                the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
                scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
                of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
                works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
                and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
                These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
                culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
                works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
                part through the use and efforts of others.
                
                For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
                expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
                associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
                is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
                elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
                terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
                Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
                
                1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
                protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
                Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
                limited to, the following:
                
                  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
                     communicate, and translate a Work;
                 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
                iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
                     likeness depicted in a Work;
                 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
                     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
                  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
                     in a Work;
                 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
                     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
                     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
                     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
                     directive); and
                vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
                     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
                     implementations thereof.
                
                2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
                of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
                irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
                Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
                of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
                future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
                worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
                treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
                medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
                including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
                purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
                member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
                successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
                revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
                equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
                as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
                
                3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
                be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
                Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
                account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
                extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
                person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
                irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
                Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
                maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
                time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
                of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
                limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
                "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
                applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
                reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
                partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
                of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
                will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
                Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
                action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
                express Statement of Purpose.
                
                4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
                
                 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
                    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
                 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
                    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
                    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
                    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
                    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
                    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
                    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
                 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
                    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
                    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
                    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
                    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
                    Work.
                 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
                    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
                    this CC0 or use of the Work.
